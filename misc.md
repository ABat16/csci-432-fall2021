# Miscelaneous Assignmnet 

Choose your own adventure!  Each of these assignments is worth up to 10 points.
The total (capped at 100) is counted as a homework grade.  The first three
assignemnts can be completed at any time BEFORE the last week of classes, but
the other miscelaneous assignments have a specific due date.

Some assignments will have specific requirements.  However, for most events, use
the following guidelines:

Throughout this semester, you will have the opportunity to attend various
seminars or events, and write a brief reflection on them for extra credit.
These reflections should be written as a formal two-page paper.  You may
consider the following questions when writing your reflection, but there are no
specific formatting requirements:

* What did you learn?
* Were there any algorithms involved? (Even if not explicitly discussed).
* What is a piece of advise that you took away?
* Did an audience member ask a question that you particularly liked or disliked?
* Is there a question that you wish you could have asked but didn't?
* If related to the event, what were you thinking about as you were leaving?
* Did this event inspire you to look something up after the event? If so, what
  was it?
* Did you meet someone new at this event who you could see as a mentor / mentee
  / collaborator in the future?
* What is your take-away message from this event?
